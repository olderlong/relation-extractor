The same goes for the residence of her daughter and 4-month grandchild, as well as those of her neighbors and cousin down the street.\n\nEven then, Gonzales considers herself lucky.\n\"It's very overwhelming,\" she told CNN on Wednesday. \"But we have community.\" \nGonzales is hardly alone in her sadness mixed with gratitude. Many others around central and southeastern Texas feel the same, glad to have survived this week's torrential rains and dangerous flooding even if their homes did not.\nFor dozens of families, though, there is no silver lining. At least 33 people -- 14 in northern Mexico, 13 in Texas plus six in Oklahoma -- have died in the severe weather, both tornadoes and flooding from raging rivers.  \nStories from the flood: A 'harrowing' rescue, a teen's life cut short\n\n\n\nAnother 14 people are missing, two of them an elderly couple lost after their rescue boat in Houston capsized. \nOutside the city in nearby Fort Bend County, deputies are searching for a 73-year-old woman who never showed up to work her shift at the convenience store Monday night. The next day, her daughter spotted her car submerged in a creek.  \nThe rest of the missing are in Hays County, where 400-odd homes were destroyed when the Blanco River swelled many times over in a few hours.\n\"It's just very heartbreaking, that we have this loss of life,\" said Kristi Wyatt, a spokeswoman for the Hays County seat in San Marcos. \"Some of those people were in a home together, celebrating the holidays, and they were swept away in the stormwater. ... It's just a terrible situation.\"\n\nSixth body found in Houston\nEven as water levels fell, the horror continued Wednesday.\nSearchers spent the day in Wimberley, the hardest-hit community in Hays County, looking for the 11 people there who are missing and, according to Wyatt, presumed dead.\nTheir efforts were hindered by the wreckage, as well as a near constant threat of thunderstorms -- an inevitable part of late spring in this part of Texas, but a dangerous one if it whips up floodwaters into a frenzy once again. \n\"Every time in rains, it poses a problem for our guys on the ground,\" said San Marcos Fire Marshal Kenneth Bell.\nOpinion: What can be done to stop deadly floods?\nThere were no discoveries of bodies Wednesday in Hays County, but there was one in Houston. After using water pumps, crews found a 31-year-old Hispanic male in a car parked along an entrance ramp to U.S. 59, the city said. \nThis makes for the sixth death so far in Houston, where more searches are underway and more danger is possible if Mother Nature strikes again.\n\nMore storms possible\nThe problem is twofold: When rain falls at a rate of an inch or so an hour, water pools in low-lying areas such as underpasses and decreases visibility to next to nothing, making it hard to go anywhere or see dangers ahead. When it comes on top of weeks of heavy rain, it swells ponds, rivers and bayous -- defining features in Houston -- and they can spill over into neighborhoods.\nThat's what happened Monday and Tuesday, when more than 11 inches fell in some spots around the United States' fourth largest city. \nMore rain is coming, with the National Weather Service noting a chance of storms for at least the next six days in Houston. \n\n\n\nAbandoned vehicles litter a flooded Interstate 45 in Houston on Tuesday.\nEXPAND IMAGE\n\nAreas farther north, including Dallas, are expected to get 2 to 4 inches from Wednesday to Sunday. And parts of eastern Oklahoma will get drenched with 4 to 6 inches of rain. \nFor Houston residents, heavy rain farther north could be as dangerous as whatever falls in the city.\n\"You think conditions are improving, but if it's raining hundreds of miles to the north, it could cause problems,\" CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri said. \n\n1,400 structures in Houston damaged\nAs if these Texans haven't had enough problems.\nIn addition to hundreds of stranded vehicles, some 1,400 structures in Houston suffered severe damage as waters crept up.\nSaundra Brown recalled her daughter waking her early Sunday with news \"the bayou was rising.\" As the family rolled up their rug, someone knocked on the door asking for shelter after their vehicle got stuck. Soon, it became apparent nobody was going anywhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJUST WATCHED\nHouston's mayor describes the devastation in the city\n\n\nReplay\nMore Videos ...\n\n\n\nMUST WATCH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHouston's mayor describes the devastation in the city 01:39\nPLAY VIDEO\n\"We just told everybody, 'Get on the couches,' \" Brown told CNN. \"Then we put the family on the dining room table. (We moved to) the counters next. And if it was going to rise more, we'd go on the roof.\"\nSix hours later, it was finally safe to get their feet back on the soaked ground. The few days since then have been spent bunking with friends and cleaning up. \n\"It wasn't fun,\" Brown said. \"We're lucky to have a big support structure.\"\n\nMiracles and tragedies\nGood things do happen. So does tragedy. Joe McComb knows both.\nHis son Jonathan, daugther-in-law Laura, grandson Andrew and granddaughter Leighton were in their vacation cabin in Wimberley on Saturday night as the Blanco River swelled.\nFirst, the family moved their cars uphill then went back into the house, which was on stilts. Within a few minutes, as the waters surged, it became evident they wouldn't be able to get to their cars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJUST WATCHED\nSisters on the phone when home washed away\n\n\nReplay\nMore Videos ...\n\n\n\nMUST WATCH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSisters on the phone when home washed away 03:50\nPLAY VIDEO\nThen came a bang, which Joe McComb thinks was something that knocked the cabin off its foundation and into the raging floodwaters. \"All of them gathered in the rooms there, holding onto furniture,\" he said. They \"started floating down the river,\" he said.\nLaura McComb called her sister just before the house hit a bridge and broke apart, scattering the family. Jonathan McComb finally got to dry land about 7 to 12 miles away, his father said.\n\"He said he was fighting the whole time and saying, 'I've got to get out of here, I've got to get out of here,' \" Joe McComb said Wednesday. \"And he said, ... 'Somehow, I was able to get up and catch a breath of air and finally ... work myself up.\"\nJonathan McComb is now in a hospital with a collapsed lung and broken sternum. As much as he's hurting from that, he's hurting more from the fact his beloved wife, his ballet-loving daughter and his baseball-playing son aren't with him.\n\"We're hoping and praying that miracles will happen,\" Joe McComb said. \"But at the same time, we're very realistic.\"\n\n\n\n\nHeavy rains flood Texas and Oklahoma 21 photos\nWorkers in Midlothian, Texas, try to relieve pressure from the dam at Padera Lake on Wednesday, May 27.
