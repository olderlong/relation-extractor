# Relation Extraction
Library to create vertices from labeled entities, and edges from interpreted relationships between entities that are within unstructured text.

## Dependency
The Relation Extraction library shares object models with the Entity Extraction library. To install the dependency locally:

	mvn scm:checkout -Dmodule.name=entity-extractor
	cd entity-extractor
	mvn clean install

## Input
* The ontology JSON file, ([stucco_schema.json](https://github.com/stucco/ontology/stucco_schema.json)), read in from the STUCCO repository.
* Output from the [Entity-Extractor](https://github.com/stucco/entity-extractor) as a [Sentences object](https://github.com/stucco/entity-extractor/blob/master/src/main/java/gov/ornl/stucco/entity/models/Sentences.java), which represents the list of words from the unstructured text, along with each word's part of speech tag, IOB tag, and domain label.
* The source of the unstructured text

## Current Process
* For each word, or phrase, labeled with a domain label:
	* Use the domain label to find the vertex type in the ontology
	* Search this sentence's set of previously created vertices, starting with the most recent
		* If a vertex is found with the same type and it does not have the property specified by the current domain label, then update this vertex's properties with the current word/phrase
		* Otherwise, create a new vertex of the corresponding type and with the appropriate property, then add it to the end of the set of vertices created for this sentence
	
* For each pair of vertices created within 2 sentences of each other:
	* Use the vertex types to search the ontology for an possible edge between them
	* If such an edge is defined in the ontology, then create an edge instance between the pair of vertices in the subgraph

See the [Relation Extraction Documentation](https://github.com/stucco/docs/wiki/relation-extraction) on the wiki for more details.

## Output
* The GraphSON formatted subgraph of the vertices and edges created

## Usage
	EntityExtractor entityExtractor = new EntityExtractor();
	Sentences sentences = entityExtractor.getAnnotatedText("The first Critical update, MS13-088, deals with 10 vulnerabilities in Microsoftâ€™s Internet Explorer (IE).");
			
	RelationExtractor relationExtractor = new RelationExtractor();
	relationExtractor.getGraph("computerworld", sentences);
	
## Test
1) Install the dependency as described [above](https://github.com/stucco/relation-extractor#dependency)

2) Run the command:

	mvn test
