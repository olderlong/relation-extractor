# Relation Extraction
Library to create vertices from labeled entities, and edges from interpreted relationships between entities that are within unstructured text.

##Dependency
The Relation Extraction library shares object models with the Entity Extraction library. To install the dependency locally:

	mvn scm:checkout -Dmodule.name=entity-extractor
	cd entity-extractor
	mvn clean install

##Input
* The ontology JSON file, ([stucco_schema.json](https://github.com/stucco/ontology/stucco_schema.json)), read in from the STUCCO repository.
* Output from the [Entity-Extractor](https://github.com/stucco/entity-extractor) as a [Sentences object](https://github.com/stucco/entity-extractor/blob/master/src/main/java/gov/ornl/stucco/entity/models/Sentences.java), which represents the list of words from the unstructured text, along with each word's part of speech tag, IOB tag, and domain label.
* The source of the unstructured text

##Current Process
* For each word, or phrase, labeled with a domain label, create a vertex based on the ontology's properties
* For each pair of vertices generated by words, or phrases, within 2 sentences of each other:
	* Search the ontology for an edge between the two vertex types
	* If there is such a edge, then create an edge instance between the pair of vertices

##Output
* The GraphSON formatted subgraph of the vertices and edges created

##Usage
	EntityExtractor entityExtractor = new EntityExtractor();
	Sentences sentences = entityExtractor.getAnnotatedText("The first Critical update, MS13-088, deals with 10 vulnerabilities in Microsoftâ€™s Internet Explorer (IE).");
			
	RelationExtractor relationExtractor = new RelationExtractor();
	relationExtractor.getGraph("computerworld", sentences);
